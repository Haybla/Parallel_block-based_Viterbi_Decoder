This is the source codes of a CUDA application named Parallel Block-based Viterbi Decoder. Techniques of design and optimization can be found in the article "A Gb/s Parallel Block-based Viterbi Decoder for Convolutional Codes on GPU" (manuscripts submitted to the 2016 IEEE Globecom Conference). 

Source codes will be updated in a soon (after some modification).
